                    <p>This project was about using Machine Learning. Specifically, it has been implemented
                        with Naive Bayes Algorithm.</p>

                    <li>Brick Breaker (C++)</li> <br>
                    <img src="images/brickbreaker.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Brick Breaker example">
                    <p>The project was about creating a game in C++. So, Myrto and her team chose to implement the Brick
                        Breaker.</p>

                    <li>Databases (SQL)</li>
                    <p>The project's purpose was to help students get familiar with Databases and SQL. Specifically,
