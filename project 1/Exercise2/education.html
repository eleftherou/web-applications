                <p>After her high school graduation, in 2017, she started studying Computer Science at <a
                        href="https://www.aueb.gr/">Athens University of Economics and Business</a>.</p>


                <p>Some projects she has completed during her studies are referred below:</p>
                <ul>

                        <p> Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board.<br>
                            The purpose of that project was to create the Reversi game using the Minimax algorithm.

                        <p>The project was about creating a game in C++. So, Myrto and her team chose to implement the
